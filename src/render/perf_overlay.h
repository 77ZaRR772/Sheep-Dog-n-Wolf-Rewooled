/* The performance overlay: frame timings in the top-left corner of the game, toggled with F3.
 *
 * A frame runs:  [game work] -> Present (flush the draws, wait for a swapchain image, submit) -> [frame limiter wait]
 * and each part is timed separately, so that the overlay shows where the time goes, not only the frame rate:
 *
 *   FPS      frames per second, and the average and worst frame time
 *   GAME     the game's own CPU work: from the end of the limiter's wait to Present (update, collision, building draws)
 *   PRESENT  the renderer's Present: uploading and recording the draws, then waiting for the GPU / vsync to hand over
 *            a swapchain image; high here (with GAME low) means the GPU or vsync is the limit
 *   LIMITER  the frame limiter's busy-wait (D3DApp::Frame_LimitFps) up to the game's frame rate cap
 *   DRAWS    draw calls and vertices the renderer submitted per frame
 *
 * Values are averaged over half a second (the worst frame over the same window), so the text is readable.
 * The renderer draws the text (src/render/sdl3/sdl3_render_device.cpp, DrawPerfOverlay) with the 5x7 font below. */
