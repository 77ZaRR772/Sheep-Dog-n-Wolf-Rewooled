### Features

- **Multiplatform:**  All Windows only APIs replaced via SDL3
- **Multiple Renderers** Support for Vulkan, DX12 and Metal
- **Modern Controllers:** Support for modern controllers via SDL3
- **Scaled Textures:** Support for swapping texture for arbitrarily sized PNGs

### For Mac users

As the releases are unsigned, you will need to run
`xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine Rewooled.app`

to prevent your OS from blocking the execution

### Building

It builds for **Windows (MSVC, x64)**, **macOS (Apple Clang, arm64)** and **Linux (Clang, x86_64 or arm64)**.

For Linux users, it is also possible to cross-compile for Windows 64-bit using MinGW-w64 (Clang) via the provided `build_win64.sh` script. This requires the `mingw-w64-gcc` package (on Arch Linux). Note that the resulting `.exe` requires the MinGW runtime DLLs (e.g., `libstdc++-6.dll`, `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`, `libwinpthread-1.dll`) to be present in the game folder to run.

You need your own copy of the game: its data is read at run time and is not part of this repository.

**How it was made:** the decompilation was done with Claude and Codex coordinating via an MCP mailbox server - reading the machine code, naming, writing the source. In-game testing and technical knowledge about the game's inner workings came from the Sheep Raider community.

### How to install

To be written nicely
